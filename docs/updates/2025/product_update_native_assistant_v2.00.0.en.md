We’ve redesigned the Virtual Assist app to provide a **more seamless, efficient, and asset-focused** experience. The new design introduces a **structured tab bar** for better navigation, giving you quick access to essential features. With this update, finding information, managing assets, and interacting with the Ask Assistant has never been easier.

## 🔄 Revamped Tab Bar: Faster & More Structured Navigation

The new **tab bar** has been redesigned to offer better navigation across the ASMPT app. Instead of only leading to the Ask Assistant, it now provides a clear **structure to access Assets, Knowledge, and Support** more efficiently.

## 🏠 Home Tab: Your Central Hub for Knowledge & Assistance

The new landing page is designed to help you get started quickly. From here, you can:  
- **Select assets** to personalize your experience.  
- **Access the Knowledge Base** to find relevant documents, tutorials, and expert answers.  
- **Ask the Assistant** directly for quick help and troubleshooting.

This redesign ensures that everything is just one tap away, making it faster and more intuitive to access the information you need.

## 💬 Ask Assistant Tab: Smarter, More Context-Aware

The **Ask Assistant** tab is now more intelligent and asset-aware. You can:  
- Ask questions in natural language and get instant, relevant answers.  
- Access troubleshooting steps, expert articles, and Knowledge Base entries for your complete asset portfolio.  
- Receive **asset-specific responses** if you’ve selected a machine—ensuring targeted, relevant guidance.

With this enhancement, the assistant tailors its responses **to your active asset**, rather than performing a general search, while a cross-product search remains available.

## 🏗️ Assets Tab: Manage & Find Equipment with Ease

The **Assets** tab provides full access to:  
- **All product lines** available in your system.  
- **Your personal inventory**, including previously scanned machines.  
- **Quick lookup options**—scan or type a serial number to find a specific asset instantly.

This structured view simplifies asset management, allowing you to keep track of machines and retrieve information effortlessly.

In the **More** tab, you’ll find:  
- **All documents, articles, and tutorials** from the Knowledge Base.  
- **Direct access to support**, ensuring you get assistance when needed.

This section serves as a central hub for learning, troubleshooting, and customer support, ensuring you have everything in one place.

## 🏭 Asset-Specific Screen: All Key Resources in One Place

When you select a specific asset, a dedicated screen provides access to:  
- 📄 **Documents** – Manuals, guides, and datasheets for the selected machine.  
- 📝 **Articles** – Troubleshooting steps, expert recommendations, and insights.  
- 🎥 **Tutorials** – Step-by-step instructional videos for maintenance and operation.  
- 🔧 **Spare Parts** – A direct view of available spare parts for repairs.  
- 📖 **Logbook** – If an asset is selected, you can now **access its logbook**, allowing you to track maintenance history and key updates.

Once a question is asked with an asset selected, the **filter automatically focuses on that asset**. The goal is to provide precise answers and ensure the correct information is delivered.

With this update, the ASMPT app delivers a **smoother, more intuitive user experience**—helping you find, manage, and troubleshoot assets faster than ever. Try it out today!
