## Product Update on Virtual Assist Web: Enhanced Product Line Filters, Knowledge Base Section, and New Tutorial Features

We‚Äôre excited to announce several key updates to improve the search interaction and information management. This release includes new features for product line filtering, enhancements to the tutorials interface, and a new Knowledge Base section, all aimed at making your interactions with Virtual Assist Web more intuitive and efficient. Below is a detailed overview of what‚Äôs new and improved!

### üÜï **Enhanced Product Line Filters for Expert Answers, Feedback, and Search History**

We have introduced new product line filters that have been added to the expert answers, feedback, and history sections. This enhancement allows editors to discover relevant information more easily by filtering through different product lines. This feature improves searchability and ensures that the most pertinent content is quickly accessible, saving time and enhancing productivity.

### üìö **Introducing the Knowledge Base Section: Centralized Access to Information**

We are thrilled to introduce the new Knowledge Base section in Virtual Assist Web, designed to provide a more centralized and efficient way of accessing knowledge. The Knowledge Base consolidates various resources, including articles, tutorials, and documents across different product lines, into one easily accessible location.

#### **How to Use the Knowledge Base:**

1. **Accessing the Knowledge Base:** 
   You can access the Knowledge Base directly from the main navigation menu. This new section serves as a hub for all information, making it easier to find what you need without having to navigate through multiple sections.

2. **Previous Access Methods Remain:** 
   While the Knowledge Base offers a new way to access information, the previous processes remain unchanged. You can still access product-specific documents in the usual manner. However, if you need to find information across different products or document types, the Knowledge Base will be your go-to resource.

   The Knowledge Base also includes the ability to upload and manage documents directly within this section. This ensures that all relevant materials are organized and easily accessible, making document management more straightforward.

### üéì **Standardized Tutorials Interface with Filter Bar**

We‚Äôve made significant improvements to the tutorials section, bringing it closer in line with the rest of the Virtual Assist Web elements. The tutorial screens have been standardized to ensure a consistent user experience. Additionally, a new filter bar has been introduced, allowing users to easily navigate and find specific tutorials. These enhancements make learning and accessing training materials more seamless and efficient.

### üè≠ **Factory Layout Enhancements**

We‚Äôve made two significant updates to the Factory Layout section to improve usability. First, the Post-Logbook Entry Landing Page has been redesigned based on user feedback, ensuring a more intuitive experience after creating a logbook entry. Second, the Line Creation Button has been moved to a more prominent position, making it easier to access, especially when multiple lines are present.
