## Product Update on Virtual Assist Web: Weekly Insights Digest for Admins, Reordering Assembly Lines, and Streamlined Tutorial Creation

In our latest update, we‚Äôve introduced several key features to enhance your Virtual Assist Web experience, including a new weekly insights digest, improved customization of the factory layout, and an improved process for creating tutorials. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of these exciting updates!

### üìß Weekly Insights Digest for Admins

We are introducing a new weekly insights digest feature that provides a summary of key activities within the system. The digest will be automatically sent to admins and will include important metrics such as:

- Unanswered questions
- Active users
- Newly created content units

This digest ensures admins stay informed of relevant updates and user engagement. The feature aims to boost interaction by keeping users connected to ongoing activities and critical changes. While the digest is enabled by default, users can opt out if preferred, offering flexibility to suit organizational needs. Client-wide, if you want to receive these insights, please contact us at [asm-support.df@asmpt.com](mailto:asm-support.df@asmpt.com).

### üîÑ Reordering Assembly Lines in Factory Layout

Editors and admins now have the ability to reorder assembly lines in the Factory Layout according to their preferences. This improvement allows users to customize the layout to display the most important or frequently used lines at the top, optimizing workflow visibility. These changes apply across the entire organization, ensuring that all users benefit from a more streamlined factory view. The reordering process is simple and intuitive, making it easier than ever to manage the factory layout effectively.

Creating tutorials is now even simpler with new drag-and-drop functionality for media elements, allowing for faster and more intuitive content creation. Additional features such as step deletion confirmation and a redesigned sidebar for easier language and machine selection have been implemented. These enhancements minimize interruptions during the tutorial creation process and improve overall usability.
