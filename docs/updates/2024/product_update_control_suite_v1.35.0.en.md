## Product Update on Virtual Assist: New Security Access Controls, Machine-Specific Document Search, and Improved Trial User Management

We’re thrilled to introduce several new features and enhancements designed to improve your experience with Virtual Assist Web. These updates include new security access controls, machine-specific document search, and a streamlined process for managing trial users. Here’s what’s new!

### 🔑 Enhanced Security with Secure Link Login

We’ve implemented new security access controls to streamline user access and increase security. One of the standout features is the **Secure Link Login**, which allows users to securely access ASMPTs Database via a link sent to their email, eliminating the need for a password. To further enhance security, new users will also be requested to create their own password, ensuring they set a personalized and secure credential for future logins. This combination of password-free access and password creation improves both security and the user experience, reducing barriers to accessing Virtual Assist Web.

### 🔍 Machine-Specific Document Search and Upload

We’re excited to announce the new machine-specific document search feature. Users can now search for documents by specifying a machine’s serial number, making it easier to locate machine-specific information in factory layouts or inventories. These documents will be clearly marked with a badge, ensuring quick identification. While this feature enables users to access machine-specific documents, manual document uploads through the UI are not yet available. If you’d like to upload documents related to a machine, please contact us and we’ll set that up for you, at [asm-support.df@asmpt.com](mailto:asm-support.df@asmpt.com).

### 🗂️ Shift Reports for Enhanced Communication

We’ve introduced a new feature allowing users to save **Shift Reports**, which function similarly to logbook entries but are specifically linked to an assembly line. Shift Reports enable users to log and store key events that occur during their specific shifts, ensuring important information is captured in a centralized location. This makes it easier to communicate critical shift-related updates to peers and colleagues, improving overall team coordination and keeping everyone informed of what’s happening in real-time.

### 🆕 Streamlined Trial User Management

Managing trial users is now simpler and more effective with our updated trial management process. Trials will automatically expire 30 days after the first user’s login, rather than from the instance creation date. These improvements make it easier to nurture trial users into long-term customers, and ensure that the time since they access the platform can be fully used to understand the features of ASMPT.
