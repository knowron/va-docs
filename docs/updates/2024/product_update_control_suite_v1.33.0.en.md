### 🗂️ **Add Product Line Filters**

We’ve introduced the ability to filter documents by product lines using a new filter feature. This addition allows editors to easily discover and organize documents and expert answers by specific product lines. Moreover, this feature supports cross-product search, enabling users to locate information across various product lines more efficiently.

### 📰 **All Article Screen**

A new "All Article" screen has been added to simplify the process of finding and managing articles. This screen provides a centralized location for editors to review or edit articles, making content management more straightforward and efficient.

We are pleased to announce that the Virtual Assist Web user interface and processing are now available in French. This update broadens accessibility and provides a better user experience for French-speaking users.

### 🛠️ **UserGuiding Onboarding Tool**

To assist new users in navigating the platform, we have implemented UserGuiding, an onboarding tool that provides step-by-step guidance and tutorials. This tool is designed to help users quickly become proficient with Virtual Assist Web’s features, ensuring a smoother and more effective onboarding experience. You can also provide feedback and access learning material through it.

### 🤖 **Follow-Up Questions for System Queries**

Our system can now generate follow-up questions and prompts when initial user queries are unclear or too short. This improvement ensures that users receive more precise and helpful responses, enhancing overall interaction with the system.
