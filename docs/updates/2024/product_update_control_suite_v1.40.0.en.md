# Product Update Virtual Assist Web V1.40.0

### Released on: 05.12.2024

## Enhanced Spare Parts Indexing, Connectivity Alerts, and Machine Editing

This update brings several impactful changes to Virtual Assist Web, aimed at streamlining spare parts management, improving connectivity awareness, and simplifying machine editing processes. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the enhancements:

### üõ†Ô∏è Spare Parts Indexing for Better Search and Identification Processes

We‚Äôve improved how spare parts are managed and searched within Virtual Assist Web. Spare Part Lists are now dynamically surfaced during searches, showcasing both the list itself and specific spare parts that match the query. Each machine can have multiple spare part lists, and these lists now provide detailed insights, including **serial codes** and additional characteristics supplied by either the spare part list or the client. 

This makes it easier to manage and locate parts for specific machines, ensuring that all relevant information is readily available. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a specific component or exploring related details, this update offers a more intuitive and organized way to navigate your spare parts inventory.

### üåê Connectivity Alerts for a Seamless Experience

A new **Lost Connection Banner** feature has been added to improve user awareness during connectivity disruptions. If the internet connection becomes weak or is lost entirely, users will receive clear notifications on the screen, enabling them to address the issue promptly. This ensures that users can continue to work efficiently and are aware of any limitations affecting their experience. This enhancement is particularly valuable for tablet users and ensures a smooth operational flow even during connectivity challenges.

### üñãÔ∏è Simplified Machine Editing and Standardized Information Display

Managing machines is now easier than ever. With this update, users can:

- **Upload individual machines** into the system effortlessly.
- Edit machines directly from either the **Factory Layout** or the **Machine Inventory**.
- Benefit from a **standardized structure** for machine information, including clear display of the machine name, the associated product line, and its serial number.
