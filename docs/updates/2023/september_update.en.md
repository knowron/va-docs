# ASMPT Virtual Assist September Update

In the last months, we have introduced a number of updates designed to make you and your colleagues' lives much easier. They are based on your feedback, so please keep it coming!

## Share documents easily with a **simple link**

**[Link Sharing](../../Features/linksharing.md)** is a powerful tool designed to streamline communication and foster teamwork. It allows you to share valuable resources with their colleagues effortlessly.

Look for the "Share" <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EMQaeuo.png" width="6%"></img> icon or option associated with the content you want to distribute.

Click on "Copy Link" and distribute the link among your colleagues .

The update is also available and completely compatible with the Virtual Assist App!

## Store machine-specific information in the new **Machine logbook**

The **[digital logbook](../../Features/logbook.md)** serves as a historical record of a machine's lifecycle. Over time, it accumulates a wealth of knowledge, insights, and best practices shared by colleagues. Read all about it [here](../../Features/logbook.md).

This rich repository of information can be invaluable for troubleshooting, training new team members, or identifying patterns and trends related to the machine's performance.

## Titles available in English and German

!!! tip "Beyond English and German"

    This feature will also be available for all other languages as they are made available in the system.

Titles for all documents are now available in **German** whenever German titles exist. These are visible in both the **Documents and All Documents screens**, as well as the **the App's Documents screen**.

The language of the title you see will depend on your UI language. If you use the system in German, you will see German titles whenever possible. Otherwise, you will see the English ones.

When filtering for documents, we will search in both the German and the English titles, so you never run into the issue of not finding what you are looking for. 

## Newer documents are more visible to users

We have increased the importance of recency for our search results, meaning that newer documents will be ranked higher for most searches. This is especially helpful for documents which have multiple superseding versions, such as software installation manuals (see below).

## Virtual Assist Web fits better on tablets

The Virtual Assist Web is more responsive on tablets and smaller screens. Whenever there is not enough space, the sidebar will collapse, giving you more space for the content you need.

## Bugfixes

Additionally, we've addressed a number of bugs in our system. Below is a list of highlights.

- Whenever we aren't sure what language your question is in, our system will generate answers based on your UI language. No more unwanted English results when asking a question in German!
- You no longer need to click twice on the result for the document to open the right page. It will now open on the right page at the first click!
- Images with the same name won't overwrite each other anymore when uploading them to different articles or tutorials. No more having to deal with renaming images or videos!
- Thumbs-up interaction is much more responsive
