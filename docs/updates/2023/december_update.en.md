## Informing users

Whenever an editor answers a users' open feedback, Virtual Assist will automatically generate an email informing them that their query has been answered.

## New tag system is now available for documents, articles and search

As part of this update, we have released a reworked tag system that is available across content units (currently documents, articles and search). 

Tags can be used to easily narrow down search results or relevant documents in the documents and articles screens. They now conform to existing data structures within your organization (e.g. Commissioning vs. Repair) and will be immediately recognizable to most users.

We will slowly continue to add content units to this system (e.g. expert answers) as time goes on. Previously, only documents could be tagged - we have now expanded that possibility to articles as well.

## Pictures can be explored more easily

We have now added a [Lightbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox_(JavaScript)) component to the product, making it easier to zoom into small images appearing on e.g. articles.

## Article drafts

Previously, articles could only be immediately published for everyone to see, making it harder to work on longer, more complex articles.

Editors can now simply save an article as a draft. This means that it will not appear on search and it will only be visible for other editors who can also edit them.

## New user feedback collection for Virtual Assist Web

As part of our drive to make it easier for users to provide their feedback, we have reworked the feedback-collecting elements on Virtual Assist Web search. 

Users will now be able to select from among pre-defined categories for giving feedback on results which aren't helpful, instead of having to elaborate much. 

Users can now also submit feedback (positive and negative) to extracted answers. Of course, this doesn't only help your colleagues close knowledge or information gaps, it also allows us to keep improving our models and product.
