# Titles now available in German and new documents available


Hello! This is **Arturo**, head of the product team for Virtual Assist. I wanted to inform you about some of the updates we have made to the system in the past two weeks, including some new documents now available.

## Titles now available in German

Titles for all documents are now available in **German** whenever German titles exist. These are visible in both the **Virtual Assist Web's Documents and All Documents screens**, as well as the **Virtual Assist App's Documents screen**.

The language of the title you see will depend on your UI language. If you use the system in German, you will see German titles whenever possible. Otherwise, you will see the English ones.

When filtering for documents, we will search in both the German and the English titles, so you never run into the issue of not finding what you are looking for.
