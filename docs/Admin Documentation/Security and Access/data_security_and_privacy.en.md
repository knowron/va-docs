# Data Security and Privacy FAQs

## Who will have access to the data and documents I have uploaded?
**Only you and members of your team** will have access to the documents you have uploaded. No other client or any user without the authorization can access them in any way shape or form. Your data is safe with us.

## What are your data protection guidelines?
We takes cybersecurity and data protection very seriously. We are compliant with GDPR where we present a privacy notice in a concise and transparent manner. We ask for user consent before tracking, keep analytics anonymous and ensure encryption of all sensitive data. We believe building a robust privacy and security program is the first
step to reinforcing customersâ€™ confidence in how we value, treat, and protect their data.

We are displaying our existing technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to our clients (upon request) and are reviewing them on a 6-month basis in order to ensure the list is up-to-date and comprehensive.

## Do you store data?

The tool data is stored entirely within the EU (Germany). Documents can be delivered through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to speed up loading. Only you can access your data (client-level) and content. This is also true when creating new product lines with products not manufactured by ASMPT.

## Do you back up any data?

Our data backup model provides near real-time database replication to ensure customer data is both backed up and available on redundant and geographically dispersed servers. Full backups are performed daily and stored encrypted in an environment physically separated from the primary servers to ensure fault tolerance.

## Are you GDPR compliant?

Yes, we are fully GDPR compliant.

## Are You ISO 27001 Certified?

Yes, our company is ISO 27001 certified. This certification confirms our commitment to implementing and maintaining robust information security management systems.

For further details on our security measures, please contact our team.

## How reliable is your infrastructure?

We deploy our code on top-tier cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services that support comprehensive security and compliance certifications, including PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, GDPR, FIPS 140-2, and NIST 800-171.

The data center is located within Europe for EU customers and their data. For network security, systems are behind a virtual private cloud where only certain IPs are allowed to access the system.

All server and network components are continuously monitored by internal staff and by the colocation providers. Access to each system, network device, and application is limited to authorized personnel, and login details within the event logs are reviewed continually.
