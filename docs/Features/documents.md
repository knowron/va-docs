# Documents

Documents related to your product or product line represent one of the content units forming the product's knowledge base. As an Editor or Admin, you can upload one single document or an entire folder.

!!! tip 
    Documents can be uploaded as a single file or an entire folder. Additionally you can search for your uploaded documents based on name or title.


Clicking on **Upload** prompts a dialog where you can edit the Document's title, change the visibility or add tags.

### **Title**

You can edit the document's **Title**, which will be displayed in the search results, although the original **File name** will also be shown in the Documents table.

### **Date created**

Every document is marked by default with the date it has been uploaded to the system. You can also change the date to the actual creation date of the document. 

### **Visibility**

Setting the Documents' visibility to **Private** would make them visible to users from your organisation only. **Public** documents can be seen by anyone who has access to the product line they belong to.

### **Tags**

Adding tags to a document is a way to categorize or label it with relevant keywords or phrases that describe its content. Tags make it easier to find specific documents by filtering their search based on those tags. Editors and Admins can create tags by typing in the name of the tag you wish to create in the Tags bar from the `Edit Metadata` dialog.

If a tag already exists, either previously created by you or your collegues it will be displyed in the list and can be selected and added to the document's tags.

Once tags have been added to documents, users can filter their search results by selecting one or more tags. This will show them only the documents that match the selected tags, making it easier to find what they are looking for. Tags can also be used to group similar documents together, providing a more organized and efficient way to access information.

    You can edit the document's metadata also after upload. All you have to do is click on the edit button :pencil2: in the Actions section of the Documents table.
