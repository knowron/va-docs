# Factory Layout


With the factory layout, we are expanding the capabilities of our platform and ensuring that information access is flexible and aligned to your own processes. We can now group specific machines in an assembly line, which mirrors your production. By enabling this clustering, we can search for information related to the machines in the product line, and we can create specific logbook entries, reports and articles related to a specific line. 

All the information you need to service and interact with an assembly line is represented in our platform, and we ensure that you can access all the resources related to it in a few second.
Your colleagues can quickly understand the current status and recent changes or services on the machine, and make questions about the line, through which our system can answer based on the context of all machines that are part of the assembly line.


### How to get started?

To access this function, you need to go to the factory layout tab on the left sidebar. Once you are in this section, you can create an assembly line that represents your own process. From here, please select from the product lines/machines you have previously uploaded and put them in the right sequence. Once your assembly line is ready, just publish it and you can find all the information you need about it.

## How does it work?

By aggregating all the information related to the machines in a product line, we make the process of finding information more flexible, and can better support the operations and maintenance of production sites. 

The linking of machines also helps in a clear visualization of changes or services done in a specific assembly line, and to update your team and keep them informed about these events. Don’t get lost in notepads or paperwork that will be lost, but rather benefit from having a digital twin of your system.


### Creating a new assembly line

To create a new assembly line, select the “New Assembly Line” button and you can you can define the name of your new layout. Then, select the machine you want to start with, and you can add additional machines based on your own line. The documentation and all other related resources will be automatically uploaded and linked here.


### Editing a product line

To change the order of a previously created factory layout, or to add or delete machines in it, you just need to select the “edit” button and you can start editing it. Here, you can add new machines or change the order from the existing machines on it.


### Accessing the information

When you have an assembly line ready and you need to access the information around it, just click on the machine that you need information about and you can ask a question about it. Additionally, you can find the properties and the serial number of it.

## What can I look for in an assembly line?

On machines from the assembly line, you can find:
