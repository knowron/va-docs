# Push notifications 


### What are push notifications?
Push notifications are messages that are sent directly to your phone or device through the ASMPT Virtual Assist app. These messages can include a wide range of information, from important updates and news to reminders. 

### How can I manage my notifications

To receive push notifications from our ASMPT Virtual Assist app, you'll need to give us permission to send them to your device. This is usually done when you first download and install the app, but you can also manage your notification settings at any time through the app's settings menu or your device's settings.

When you receive a push notification from the ASMPT Virtual Assist app, you'll see a small pop-up message on your device's screen. You can then choose to either dismiss the notification or take action by tapping on it. If you want to check your notifications later, all you have to do is click on the :bell: in the upper right corner of your screen.
