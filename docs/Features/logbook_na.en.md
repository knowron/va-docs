# Logbook on Mobile
!!! note

    The machine logbook is also available for the [web](./logbook_cs.md). For more general information on the logbook feature, visit our [feature page](./logbook.md).


## How to get started with the machine logbook
First, scan the machine whose logbook you want to access. You can do this by scanning the QR code attached to it or typing in the serial number. Afterwards, simply tap on the "Logbook" :material-history: icon under the product image!

You **cannot** access the logbook from a Product Line.

!!! note

    Can't find the serial number of the machine standing in front of you? Make sure the machine has been created on your [Virtual Assist Web](./machineinventory.md)!

### Adding a logbook entry

Simply tap on the "Add entry" :material-plus: button to add a new entry.

Be sure to add a title and a category, as well as describe the work that was done on the machine. You can also attach images or videos you have previously taken. A picture is worth more than a thousand words!

### Viewing logbook entries

At any point, you can see all of the entries you and your colleagues have added for a specific machine. You can also see pictures and play the videos attached to them.

You can also use the filters to search for specific text or the date of the logbook entry to narrow things down.
