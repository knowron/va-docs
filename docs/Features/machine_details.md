# Machine Details 

Accessing `Machine Details` is a simple two-step process. Firstly, you can either scan or add the serial number of a new machine. The system will automatically select the machine, and by clicking on the machine image, you will be redirected to the Machine Details screen. On this screen, you can view the machine details and also delete it from your inventory.
