# Logbook
## What is the machine logbook?
The digital logbook serves as a **historical record of a machine's lifecycle**. Over time, it accumulates a wealth of knowledge, insights, and best practices shared by colleagues. This rich repository of information can be invaluable for troubleshooting, training new team members, or identifying patterns and trends related to the machine's performance.

The digital logbook allows users to **create entries specific to individual machines**, where they can share text and video content for all their colleagues in the shop floor.

## How to get started with the machine logbook
First, scan the machine whose logbook you want to access. You can do this by scanning the QR code attached to it or typing in the serial number. Afterwards, simply tap on the "Logbook" :material-history: icon under the product image!

You **cannot** access the logbook from a Product Line.

!!! note

    Can't find the serial number of the machine standing in front of you? Make sure the machine has been created on your [Virtual Assist Web](./machineinventory.md)!

### Adding a logbook entry

Simply tap on the "Add entry" :material-plus: button to add a new entry.

Be sure to add a title and a category, as well as describe the work that was done on the machine. You can also attach images or videos you have previously taken. A picture is worth more than a thousand words!

### Viewing logbook entries

At any point, you can see all of the entries you and your colleagues have added for a specific machine. You can also see pictures and play the videos attached to them.

You can also use the filters to search for specific text or the date of the logbook entry to narrow things down.

## Who can see my machine's logbook?
The logbook entries are visible to all colleagues from the same company who have access to the platform. **No outside users can see either your machines or your logbook entries.**

This enables knowledge sharing and collaboration among team members. Colleagues can view, learn from, and even comment on the entries made by others, fostering a collaborative environment and facilitating continuous learning.


## What kind of information can I add to a machine's logbook?
Users have the flexibility to include **text, image and video content** in their logbook entries. They can write detailed descriptions, notes, or instructions about the machine's operation, maintenance, etc. 

Entries have **categories** which roughly correspond to most common use cases for the logbook: 

- Parts exchange
- Report problem
- Shift information
- Other

If you wish to add any other categories to your companies' deployment, please contact us at any time.
