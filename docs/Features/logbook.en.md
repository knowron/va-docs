# Logbook
## What is the machine logbook?
The digital logbook serves as a **historical record of a machine's lifecycle**. Over time, it accumulates a wealth of knowledge, insights, and best practices shared by colleagues. This rich repository of information can be invaluable for troubleshooting, training new team members, or identifying patterns and trends related to the machine's performance.

The digital logbook allows users to **create entries specific to individual machines**, where they can share text and video content for all their colleagues in the shop floor.

## How to get started with the machine logbook
The logbook is available for both the [web](./logbook_cs.md) and the [mobile app](./logbook_na.md). You can visit the corresponding pages for a more in-depth look at how to use them.

## Who can see my machine's logbook?
The logbook entries are visible to all colleagues from the same company who have access to the platform. **No outside users can see either your machines or your logbook entries.**

This enables knowledge sharing and collaboration among team members. Colleagues can view, learn from, and even comment on the entries made by others, fostering a collaborative environment and facilitating continuous learning.


## What kind of information can I add to a machine's logbook?
Users have the flexibility to include **text, image and video content** in their logbook entries. They can write detailed descriptions, notes, or instructions about the machine's operation, maintenance, etc. 

Entries have **categories** which roughly correspond to most common use cases for the logbook: 

- Parts exchange
- Report problem
- Shift information
- Other
