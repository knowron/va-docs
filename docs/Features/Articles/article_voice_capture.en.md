# Capturing Articles by Voice

Capturing articles by voice is only currently supported in the Virtual Assist Web. It can be used on both tablet and laptop, any device with a microphone will work.

Our new Voice Input feature is tailor-made for blue-collar workers in field service and shop floor settings to enable hands-free data entry directly through voice. This feature leverages our AI technology to refine voice input for accuracy and integrates pre-existing templates for various industrial scenarios, simplifying the capture and documentation of field expertise. 

Our goal is to make it significantly easier and faster to capture and improve the quality of information shared across your organization.

## How to access the feature

Currently, only editors (or equivalent) and above can capture documents by voice. Please contact your system administrator if you believe you should have access to this feature.

You can access the Voice Input feature in the same way you can create any new article.
- Log into the Virtual Assist Web
- Select the product line for which you want to create a new article
- Navigate to the article overview screen
- Click on “Create”
- Follow the instructions (see below)

### Instructions

After selecting “Create”, a pop-up will appear, offering you to create an article from a template or from scratch.

**Selecting a template**

The easiest way to structure your thinking and capturing information in one go is by using a template. You can pick from among the list of templates we have available by default or any custom defaults your organization might have already created. If you want to create a new template, please reach out to our support team.

You can of course, choose to create an article without selecting a template.

**Record your voice note**

Now all you have to do is record your voice note. Click on the microphone button and wait until the we can start listening. 

**Make sure that you enable your browser to capture your microphone input!** Don’t worry, we wont store your voice, only transcribe it to text.

Once the stop button start pulsating you can speak! There is no limit to what you can say, but we recommend limiting it to 3 minutes - otherwise you’ll probably start repeating yourself. If you selected a template, you will see the headers of the template at the top of the pop-up to help you remember what you should mention.

Once you are done, simply click on the “stop” button in the middle of the pop-up.

**Submitting your voice note**

Once you have recorded your voice note, you can elect to submit it or record it again. You can also listen back to it, in case you are unsure. Simply click “Continue” to submit your recording.

We will now process your voice note. This might take a little while if your voice note is long. 

**Reviewing the article**

We use AI to clean up your voice input and create an article. This means that it might contain some inaccuracies. Please review the text before storing it.

After processing your text, you will see the resulting article. You will notice we have removed any repetitive information and filled out the template, if you used one. 

You have the opportunity to redo the recording or add the text to your article! Don’t worry, you’ll still have the opportunity to edit it later.

**Editing your article**

You can now edit your newly-created article, either by using the traditional text editor or by using voice once again!

To edit your article with voice, simply click on the “Edit with voice” button at the bottom of your article editor screen. Following the instructions work the same as above, but this time you don’t have to say everything once again, only what you would like to change!

We give you the opportunity to check whether you want to keep the new or the old version before accepting changes proposed by the system.

## FAQs

#### Do you store my voice recordings? 

We do not store your voice recordings at all. We simply delete them once we have extracted the information and turn them into text.
