# Articles

Articles allow you, editors and admins, to create free-form content. While Tutorials are structured and have a specific purpose to their own, Articles allow you to write anything from a frequently asked question to a problem-solution piece for commonly encountered issues. Articles can be linked to any other content in the knowledge base.

## How to create an Article?

As an user with the **Admin** or **Editor** role you can create, edit or delete Articles.
To create an Article, all you have to do is click on the `Create` button and the Articles dialog will be opened.

We offer two options for creating your content. You can either use our pre-made template, called the `Error/Solution Template`, or create your own content from scratch.

Our `Error/Solution Template` is designed to simplify the process of creating error documentation. It includes different sections for specifying the machine type and error number, and it also provides an inbuilt editor that allows you to easily create lists and add images.

!!! tip Visibility of your Articles
     The visibility of a newly created Article is private by default. This means that only people from your organization are able to see **private** Articles. Changing the visibility to Public makes the Article visible to any user with access to the product line the Article falls under.

In the `ACTIONS` pannel, you can choose to preview, edit, delete and share articles.
