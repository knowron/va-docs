# Troubleshooting

## What is troubleshooting
Troubleshooting leads you through a series of simple questions that you can easily answer, so that you can systematically find what problem your machine or process is facing. 

At the end of the troubleshooting questions, you will receive a "diagnosis" explaining what the issue is and what to do about it.

## Accessing troubleshooting
Once you've [selected your product line](../Getting%20Started/quick-start-guide-assistant.md), all you have to do is tap on the `Troubleshooting` icon on the home screen.

!!! warning "Not all product lines will have troubleshooting content"

    If you don't see any troubleshooting available for your product line, or if the troubleshooting is empty once you've selected it, your editors might not have created troubleshooting trees yet!

    Ask your admin about when you can expect troubleshooting for the product lines you are interested in.

## Going through a troubleshooting tree

After accessing troubleshooting, you will see a series of questions that try to determine the exact nature of the problem you are facing. Answer them simply. At the end you will find yourself with a diagnosis, explaining to you what problem you are facing.

The diagnosis will also normally link you to what to do about it. This can be in the form of:

- a tutorial
- an article
- a document in your knowledge base
- the contact details of the support team of your service organization
