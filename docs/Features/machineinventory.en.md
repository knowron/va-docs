#  Machine Inventory

## What is the machine inventory?
The Machine Inventory feature allows you to keep track of your product instances. Each machine has a unique serial number, configuration data, and maintenance history associated with it. With this feature, you can easily monitor and manage your products, ensuring their optimal performance and maintenance.

Just click on the View button :material-eye-circle: and a side panel will be opened, showing you the details for that specific machine.
