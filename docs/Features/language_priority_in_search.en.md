# Language Priority in Search


When you submit a query to our system, the language used in your query is crucial for how we process and respond to it. Our approach to handling language is designed to ensure that you receive a response in a language you understand. Here's how we prioritize languages during the search process:


## Step 1: Query Language Detection


- **Primary Action**: The system first attempts to **detect the language of your query**. This detection is based on analyzing the text you've submitted.

- **Response Language**: If detection is successful and the detected language is one of our **supported languages**, we will respond to your query in that language.


## Step 2: Fallback to UI Language


- **Condition**: If the system **cannot detect the language** of your query with confidence, we proceed to the next step.

- **UI Language**: Your **UI language** comes into play here. This is the language you've set for the user interface of our platform or service. It's essentially the language you've chosen to navigate menus, read instructions, and interact with the interface.

- **Response Language**: In cases where the query language is unclear, we will **default to responding in your UI language**. This ensures that even if we're unsure about the language of your query, you'll receive a response in a language you're familiar with.


### What is my UI Language?


The **UI Language** refers to the language setting you've selected for the user interface of a software application or platform. It determines the language used for:

- Menus

- Buttons

- Help text

- Other interface elements


This setting helps ensure that you can navigate and use the software comfortably in your preferred language.
