# Insights


The Insights Dashboard makes sure that editors and admins can understand how well their system was performing and were empowered to close the knowledge gaps in their organization.

Through interactive visualizations and detailed analytics, the Insights Dashboard enables editors and administrators to view the impact of their content strategy. It highlights areas of success, allowing them to replicate effective approaches, while also pinpointing potential shortcomings that may contribute to knowledge gaps

### What is the current status of my system?

The main page of the dashboard answers this question by showing the percentage of questions answered, total searches and submitted user feedback.

### How is my system progressing over time?

The two graphs in this section show you the percentage of questions answered, i.e. the questions for which a user sees a generated answer from our system. A higher number is often indicative of a system capable of serving users the information they need - we recommend targeting a benchmark of around 75%.

Additionally, you can monitor the number of queries searched, or the number of individual questions submitted by users over the past weeks. These will fluctuate with time, but the higher the better. You'll also be able to see the change in these numbers over the last week.


### Top unanswered questions

This table shows you the top unanswered questions in your knowledge base. You can affect this table by uploading new sources which answer the questions or directly writing an expert answer about it

### What are the frequently asked questions?

Finally, the most frequently asked questions are shown. These can be an important barometer in understanding whether users are finding what they need, regardless of whether they are receiving a generated answer from our system or not.

## **History**

The search history feature provides an overview of all the searches conducted within the system and assess the effectiveness of the system's responses. This tool is particularly valuable as it grants access to both the queries made and the corresponding answers provided to the user, alongside any feedback provided.

In the `User Feedback` column, you can view the feedback given by the user for each answer. Additionally, the `User Comment` column includes any additional comments from the user, along with explanations or clarifications regarding their feedback.

## **Feedback**

The feedback feature helps editors to respond to user feedback and contribute expert answers for improved system performance. By selecting `Edit Answer,` users are  redirected to the [Expert Answers](#expert-answers) page, where they can create a response to the user's query.

The editing page allows for inclusion of detailed answers and also facilitates the attachment of relevant sources such as [articles](articles.md), [documents](documents.md), and [tutorials](tutorials.md) to enhance the credibility of the response.

The `Status` indicates whether an answer has been added to the user's feedback. 

## **Expert Answers**

Expert Answers: One of the main changes we have introduced is an all-new way to directly and simply answer users' questions.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RYrP58D.gif" width="80%"></p>

Whenever a user submits a feedback about the answer they have received or the search results in front of them, a new feedback item will be created. You can answer these feedback items (or unanswered questions, see above) with an Expert Answer.

Expert answers are the best way to close gaps in your knowledge base. Think of them as similar to a dynamic FAQ list: an editor answer a user's query and any subsequent query that is similar will see the Expert Answer as one of the top sources.

Expert answers behave much like articles: you can quickly write information and attach images or links to it. The expert answer will also show up on search like other sources, but it will be treated with priority for the query which it answered originally.

Expert answers can also contain sources, which refer the user to other articles or documents which might help them look up a specific value or data point. Please note that the public visibility of an expert answer might change based on the sources attached: expert answers with private sources are automatically private!
