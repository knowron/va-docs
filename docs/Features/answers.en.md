# AI-generated answers

Generative Question Answering leverages the power of artificial intelligence to generate dynamic, contextually appropriate responses. You can expect AI-generated answers to appear when asking a question. The system utilizes advanced algorithms to match the inputted question with the uploaded documents and extract the most relevant information. The accuracy and availability of the answers also depend on the quality of the uploaded documents.

#### Why is my question not answered?

If you haven't received a generative answer to your question, there are several possible explanations. It could be due to the question being too broad or lacking specific details, limitations in the knowledge base, or the ambiguity of the question. 
Here are a few examples of why you didn't get the desired answer and how to fix it:


#### Your query was asked too broadly and no answer can be formulated from the top results.

To obtain accurate information, we recommend narrowing down your search by using more specific keywords or phrases related to your query. Refining your search criteria will help generate relevant results tailored to your needs.

Formulating the query **as a question** and adding specific details will result in a generative answer:

#### The information you are looking for is not found in the documents provided

In some instances, it is possible that not all documents related to a specific product or product line have been uploaded by your organization. If you come across missing documents, please click on the `Notify` button, and we will promptly make the requested documents available for you.

#### You were looking for something that is in an image

Our current system does not support image recognition for extracting text from images. Our expertise lies in natural language processing and tasks centered around textual data. We also offer Object Character Recognition (OCR) to work with screenshots and documentations based on images, to extract the different text on it. For more information, please contact [support@knowron.com](mailto:support@knowron.com).

As it can be seen in this example the answer to the query `What is included in the basic support plan?` leads to a piece of text from an image. Since the system cannot identify text in images, there is no generated answer provided for this query. 

#### Exact match 

"Exact match" is the process of finding results that exactly match the query enclosed within quotation marks (" "). When a search term is enclosed in quotes, the search engine will only return results that contain the exact word or phrase, without considering synonyms or variations. This will help you find specific and precise information, avoiding irrelevant or loosely related results.
