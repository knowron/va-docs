# AI-generated answers

Generative Question Answering leverages the power of artificial intelligence to generate dynamic, contextually appropriate responses. You can expect AI-generated answers to appear when asking a question. The system utilizes advanced algorithms to match the inputted question with the uploaded documents and extract the most relevant information. The accuracy and availability of the answers also depend on the quality of the uploaded documents.

#### Why is my question not answered?

If you haven't received a generative answer to your question, there are several possible explanations. It could be due to the question being too broad or lacking specific details, limitations in the knowledge base, or the ambiguity of the question. 
Here are a few examples of why you didn't get the desired answer and how to fix it:


#### Your query was asked too broadly and no answer can be formulated from the top results.

To obtain accurate information, we recommend narrowing down your search by using more specific keywords or phrases related to your query. Refining your search criteria will help generate relevant results tailored to your needs.

Formulating the query **as a question** and adding specific details will result in a generative answer:

#### The information you are looking for is not found in the documents provided

In some instances, it is possible that not all documents related to a specific product or product line have been uploaded by your organization. If you come across missing documents, please click on the `Notify` button, and we will promptly make the requested documents available for you.

#### The documentation might be using a different name for the topic that you are looking for

In some cases, it is possible that you may encounter a situation where you are searching for an abbreviation of a word that is not present in the knowledge base for a specific product or product line. This is evident in the provided example, where the search for the abbreviation `What is the torque for a CPP head?` does not yield any results:

 But when searching for the word itself `What is Polylactic acid?` the query yields in a generative answer:

#### You were looking for something that is in an image

Our current system does not support image recognition for extracting text from images. Our expertise lies in natural language processing and tasks centered around textual data.

As it can be seen in this example the answer to the query `What is included in the basic support plan?` leads to a piece of text from an image. Since the system cannot identify text in images, there is no generated answer provided for this query.
