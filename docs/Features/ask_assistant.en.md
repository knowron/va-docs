## **Skills**

The **Ask Assistant** is designed to support you in the following ways:

### 1. **Chat**
Start a conversation with the assistant. It can help you reach a specific asset, translate or correct the grammar of a text, or give you advice regarding general inquiries. Use it as your partner and expert in various topics, available 24/7.

!!! note
    Example Query: “Write an email explaining the above. Write it in Portuguese please.”

### 2. **Search**
The Assistant can access the different resources uploaded to Virtual Assist. This means that all documents, articles, tutorials, expert answers and the logbook entries can be found through chat interactions.

When asking a question or manually activating the Search skill manually, the Assistant will look through all the knowledge sources available and provide the best possible answer. This answer also has sources to argument it and to check where the information came from.

!!! note
    Example Query: “Did this machine get a head replacement recently?”

### 3. **Document Match**
Sometimes you might not need a full answer from the Assistant, but you need to access a document quickly. For this reason we enabled the Document Match skill. This means that when asking the assistant for a specific document title or telling it to show a specific document, it will perform a smart document search, and show the matches it found. 

The goal is to ensure you can access information from a single place and for the assistant to adjust to your needs, and your own necessities when retrieving knowledge.

!!! note
    Example Query: “Let me get the conformity declaration”

## **How to Use Ask Assistant?**

### 1. **Decide Which Context to Use**
You can start with a wide approach on the context the Ask Assistant will have, or you can use the Filters Tab on top of the screen, to select a specific asset or assets you want to work with. This ensures that the interactions will focus on specific assets and have less information available at the time of asking questions, to have more accurate results. 

Depending on your interaction, you should define the context through the filters. If you are not sure where you are looking for information, use a wide approach and let. the Ask Assistant guide your questions with our narrowing down mechanisms. 

Else, if you are sure of where your information is, you can always set up the specific asset you want to work it as a filter and then ask the questions, so your results become more accurate.

### 2. **Structure Your Query**
To get the best results:

- Use natural language: Write your question as if you were asking a colleague. This will help the system and provide better interactions.

### 3. **Refine and Iterate**
If the results aren't what you expected:

- Use the Assistant's suggestions to clarify or refine your query.

## **How do I make the most out of the Ask Assistant?**

### **1. Be Specific**
Instead of asking "How does this work?" try:

- "How do I calibrate the energy inverter for a new solar panel?"
- "What are the troubleshooting steps for a misaligned conveyor belt in Line 3?"

### **2. Leverage Feedback**
If the Assistant suggests refining your query or selecting a specific context to work with, consider adding details or clarifying terms to improve the response quality. The results will improve with the additional information provided.

## **How can I make the Assistant learn from my interactions?**

Your feedback is essential for improving the Ask Assistant feature. If you find the results unhelpful or inaccurate:

- **Mark Results Not Helpful:** Share details about why the result didn't meet your expectations.
- **Downvote the Answer:** Provide specific feedback on how the answer can be improved.
- **Upvote Helpful Answers:** Let us know when the Assistant meets or exceeds your expectations.
