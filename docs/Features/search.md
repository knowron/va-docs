#  Search - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The search function allows you to ask questions about an entire product line or a particular machine in all content units created or uploaded by you or other users. These content units come in the shape of [documents](documents), [tutorials](tutorials) or [articles](articles) so we can get you the most valuable result for your query.

!!! tip "Improve your results"
      If you formulate your query as a question, the search results will improve compared to a simple query.

The response generated is a stochastic outcome to your query, supported by the listed sources. This suggests that the answer to the same query may not consistently yield identical results.

Formulating your query as a question implies adding more details to your query and prompts the algorithm to retrieve the most relevant answer to your question from the knowledge base of that specific product line or a particular machine.

##  **Search Results**

The results of your query are prioritized by relevancy and then recency. That is also applied when the source of the result is in a different language than the query. Simply put, if you ask a question in German, but the document where the answer is found is in English, the results will show you the translated document with your answer in German.

      The automated translation will be indicated by the following tag and banner:

Results of a search query are marked with tags indicating the original language of the content, as well as from where was the answer extracted: [documents](documents),  [tutorials](tutorials) or [articles](articles).

## **Filters**

Filters can help you narrow your search based on **tags**–depending on the selected machine or product line, **language**, or the **publication date** of the documents.

#### 1.  **Language** 

You can filter based on the existing languages supported by your organization. The Language that is selected by default is the Language of your system. 

Selecting the tag “All Languages“ will provide results in all languages that are listed in the filter dropdown. Choosing only one Language will show you results in that Language and documents that have been translated from their original Language to your selected filter.

#### 2. **Publication date**

Additionally, you can filter the documents based on the **publication date** of the documents. These filters can be especially useful if you search for the newest version of a Software document.

#### 3. **Tags**

You can add tags to documents when uploading a new document or by editing an already uploaded one. For more details on how to add tags, check the [Documents](documents) page.
Tags can help you filter for specific types of documents, such as `Software` or `User Manuals`, and narrow the search to be as accurate as possible.
