#  Search

Product lines represent the machines, plants or processes your organization supports which you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the ASMPT Virtual Assist system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about? Before you start with your search, you have to select what product line you are interested in. You simply have to click on it and the context menu on the left of your screen will unfurl and you will be taken to the search screen.
The search function allows you to ask questions about an entire product line or a particular machine in all content units created or uploaded by you or other users. These content units come in the shape of [documents](documents.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md), [articles](articles.md) or [expert answers](insights.md#expert-answers) so we can get you the most valuable result for your query.

The response generated is a stochastic outcome to your query, supported by the listed sources. This suggests that the answer to the same query may not consistently yield identical results.

##  **Search Results**

The results of your query are prioritized by relevancy and then recency. That is also applied when the source of the result is in a different language than the query. Simply put, if you ask a question in German, but the document where the answer is found is in English, the results will show you the translated document with your answer in German.

!!! information "**Translated Results** "
      The automated translation will be indicated by the following tag and banner:

Results of a search query are marked with tags indicating the original language of the content, as well as from where was the answer extracted: [documents](documents),  [tutorials](tutorials) or [articles](articles).

## **Filters**

Filters can help you narrow your search based on **tags**–depending on the selected machine or product line, **language**, or the **publication date** of the documents.


#### 1.  **Language** 

You can filter based on the existing languages supported by your organization. The Language that is selected by default is the Language of your system. 

Selecting the tag “All Languages“ will provide results in all languages that are listed in the filter dropdown. Choosing only one Language will show you results in that Language and documents that have been translated from their original Language to your selected filter.

IIf you wish for the system to support a language other than our default options(`English`,`German`, `Spanish`, `Chinese`), please reach out to our [sales team](mailto:sales@knowron.com).

#### 2. **Publication date**

Additionally, you can filter the documents based on the **publication date** of the documents. These filters can be especially useful if you search for the newest version of a Software document.

#### 3. **Tags**

You can refine your search by using tags as filters, ensuring that you receive responses exclusively from articles or documents associated with the specific tag or tags you've chosen. Additionally, tags are organized in a hierarchical structure, enabling the use of multiple levels of tag categories such as `Software` or `User Manuals`.
