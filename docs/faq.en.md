## Why does my keyword search not work? 

ASMPT Virtual Assist is a software product optimized for natural language queries, allowing you to ask questions in a conversational manner for more accurate answers. The system is designed to provide more contextual information, resulting in more precise answers when you ask detailed questions. Unlike traditional keyword search systems, ASMPT Virtual Assist uses special notations to locate exact matches of desired keywords, such as "keyword." This feature ensures that you get the most relevant answers to your queries.

The system still supports keyword search, but asking detailed questions provides the most precise answers. If you have a specific document you want to download, you can use the documents screen to locate it. This feature enables you to easily access the information you need, without having to spend time searching for it.

## How do I change the language on the platform?

There are two options you can use to change the language on our platform. For desktop, you can change the language of the complete platform in the product selection page, by selecting language option in the top right corner.

Another option is to perform the search in a different language than the system settings, by selecting the language you want in the search bar configuration panel.
