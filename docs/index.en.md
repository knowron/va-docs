## Why should you use ASMPT Virtual Assist?

**A single source of truth for your service organization**

Are the assembly instructions for this machine on the service manual or on the user's manual you have printed out? Or was it on the training documentation on Sharepoint?

With ASMPT Virtual Assist, there's no question anymore - find everything in one place.

**Lightning fast access to your information**

Ask a question in your own words from your phone, laptop, or tablet and get the right answer, all in 5 seconds flat. ASMPT Virtual Assist frees your time for the work that matters most.

**ASMPT Virtual Assist answers your questions**

Whenever possible, we will try to formulate exact answers to the questions you're asking so that you don't have to look things up in dense documentation - our AI does it for you.

**Tutorials and troubleshooting to lighten the load**

You're an expert in your field, but a little help is always good. Follow step-by-step instructions with images and videos to make sure maintenance and repair processes are a breeze.

**Your questions reach the right person every time**

In the event you don't find anything that will help you do your job, your colleagues in technical documentation or first level support should find out so that it doesn't happen again. ASMPT Virtual Assist will let them know.
