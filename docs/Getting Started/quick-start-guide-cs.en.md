## Step 1. Log into the Virtual Assist Web

The Virtual Assist Web is accessible under [virtualassist.smt.asmpt.com](https://virtualassist.smt.asmpt.com/).

[Visit the Virtual Assist Web](https://virtualassist.smt.asmpt.com/){ .md-button }

You only need your email and your ASMPT Virtual Assist password to log onto the system. Your **email** is normally your work email. You can find your **password** in the email you received inviting you to join your organization on ASMPT Virtual Assist (see below).

??? info "Need help finding your password or invitation email?"

    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QKwIRJ3.png" width="100%"><figcaption>This is where you find your password in the invitation email.</figcaption></p>

    If you do not remember your password, you can reset it right on [virtualassist.smt.asmpt.com](https://virtualassist.smt.asmpt.com/). Simply click on "Forgot Password" and follow the instructions on the screen.

    If you have not received an email inviting you to ASMPT Virtual Assist, please contact your colleagues who are working with it or [request access here](https://smt.asmpt.com/en/products/software-solutions/virtual-assist).

## Step 2. Select a product line

Once logged in, you will see an overview of the product lines that your colleagues have created.

**Product lines** represent the machines, plants or processes your organization supports which you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the ASMPT Virtual Assist system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about?

Before you continue, you have to select what product line you are interested in. You simply have to click on it and the context menu on the left of your screen will unfurl and you will be taken to the search screen.

## Step 3. Ask a question

Now all you have to do is ask what you want to know. Type in the search bar and press enter. ASMPT Virtual Assist will then go through your entire knowledge base and show you the most relevant results.

Below is a sample search interaction for the question `How do I replace the DP drive on a CP 20 P2?`

We can show you results from the following resources:

- Documents
- Tutorials
- Articles

In the future, we will also be able to show you results from your machine's logbook and much more!

!!! tip "Asking questions will give you better results"

    ASMPT Virtual Assist uses state-of-the-art NLP to understand what you are looking for and bring up the most relevant results. If you formulate your query as a **question**, it will yield **better results**.

    > Example

    Instead of `DP drive CP 20 P2`, ask `How do I replace the DP drive on a CP 20 P2?`

## Step 4. Give feedback

ASMPT Virtual Assist can only get better if you give feedback! Feedback will be taken into account for the search algorithm and will even help your colleagues create better content for everyone in your organization.

You can give feedback in one of two ways:

### Use "thumbs-up" to mark results that helped you

If you found a result that helped you, you can give it a thumbs-up (see below).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6k68K3K.gif
" width="70%"></p>

A thumbs-up takes less than a second and it lets your colleagues know that this will be helpful to them too if they face a similar question. ASMPT Virtual Assist's algorithm will also take it into account: more thumbs-up reactions mean that this result will appear higher in search results in the future.

### Report any missing data for your colleagues to close the knowledge gap

Sometimes, ASMPT Virtual Assist will not find a suitable answer - or the answer might be slightly off. This can happen particularly due to a very broad query or missing data.

If you find that the search results are not helping you in the way that you need, you can click on `RESULTS NOT HELPFUL` at the top of the search results and give us details on what you were expecting (see below).

Your colleagues with an editor role, mostly from first-level support or hotline duty will act on your feedback and make sure that the information you need is available to you and your colleagues.
