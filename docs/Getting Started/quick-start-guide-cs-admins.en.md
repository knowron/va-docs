## <span style="color:#ac3229">**Product Line** </span> 

Once logged in, you will see an overview of the product lines that your main organization has added or your fellow admin or editor colleagues.

**Product lines** represent the machines, plants, or processes your organization supports that you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the ASMPT Virtual Assist system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about?

Before you continue, you can either select what product line you are interested in or create a new one for your organization.

By clicking on the `Create` button a new dialog is prompted. Here you have to add the **Display name** of the product line and you can choose to add an Image or create sample tutorials and troubleshooting for this specific product.

!!! tip
       You can later edit the Display Name or add a (new) picture for your newly created product line.


#### <span style="color:#172B4D">**To publish or not to publish?**</span>

After you have created your product line, it will appear under the "Subtenant Product Lines". The product's default is unpublished, which means that your colleagues won't be able to see the product or any other types of content attached to this product (Tutorials, Articles, Troubleshooting, and [Documents](../Features/documents.md)).


By clicking on the :pencil2: icon on the product line, the dialog pops up again and you can use the toggle button to publish your product. By simply clicking on the desired product, the context menu on the left of your screen will unfurl.

## <span style="color:#ac3229">**Charts** </span>


Charts allows you, as an Admin, to have an overview of where and by how many users ASMPT Virtual Assist has been used. This will allow you to see the crucial business value of the product. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Y2lGyr.png" width="70%"></p>

You can check the **Number of online machines**, the **Number of answered questions**, and a graph indicating the **Weekly active users**. Additionally, for better visualization, we provide you with a map that shows you the location of the **active machines**.

## <span style="color:#ac3229">**Tutorials** </span> 

**Tutorials** provide an instinctive method of delivering process knowledge regarding a product or product line. They can be used to guide customers through a process or to provide your employees with a step-by-step guide on how to perform a task.


!!! warning 
       Tutorials just like product lines are dependent on your organization. That means that you, as an admin, can see the tutorials outside your organsiation although not edit or create them.

Inside your organization, you can **create**, **edit**, or **delete** tutorials, as well as set them as published or unpublished and change their visibility. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hOZdtZt.gif" width="90%"></p>


As an Admin, you can create a tutorial by clicking on the `Create` button which will prompt you to the `Tutorial Editor` page. Here you can add steps and images as well as change the visibility of the tutorial. In order to reach a wider audience, tutorials allow you to add content in other languages.

## <span style="color:#ac3229">**Documents** </span> 

Documents related to your product or product line represent one of the content units forming the product's knowledge base. As an Admin, you can upload one single document or an entire file.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JlNeVt4.gif" width="90%"></p>


When uploading a single document, you are prompted to edit the document's metadata such as Title, Date of creation, or add Tags. This feature allows you to provide more insight into the document type you are uploading and facilitates the search process. This feature can also be triggered when clicking on the edit button :pencil2: from the Actions menu.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/89eflS2.gif" width="70%"></p>


!!! Tip
      Creating a tag when uploading/editing a document, such as `Service Manual, automatically adds it to the Search filters and offers you the possibility to filter based on tags and narrows your results.

## <span style="color:#ac3229">**Articles** </span> 

Articles allow you, admins, to create free-form content. While Tutorials are structured and have a specific purpose to their own, Articles allow you to write anything from a frequently asked question to a problem-solution piece for commonly encountered issues. Articles can be linked to any other content in the knowledge base.
